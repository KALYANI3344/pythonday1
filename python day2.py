"""
An arthimetic operator is used to perform some mathematical/arthimetic
the operators are +,-,*,/,//,%,**
note:input()is a function which takes input from user
"""
a=int(input("enter a number:"))
b=int(input("enter a number:"))
print("the addition",a+b)
print("the substration",a-b)
print("the multiplication",a*b)
print("the division",a/b)#which returns the quotient
print ("theffloordivision ",a//b)#which returns the integeral quotient part in a division 
print("the modulardivision",a%b)#which returns thd remaider part before the decimal 
print("the power",a**b)#which returns the power


"""
realtional/comparision operators are used to compare the values
and return the boolean they are
>,<, >=,,=, == !=
"""
a=int(input("enter a number:"))
b=int(input("enter a number:"))
print("the greater value",a>b)
print("the lesser value",a<b)
print("the greather than or equals to value",a>=b)
print("the less than or equals too value",a<b)
print("the equals too value",a==b)
print("the not equals too values",a!=b)
